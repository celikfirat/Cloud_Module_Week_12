## Assignment: Set Up an Azure Virtual Machine with a Free Account

## Objective

#### The purpose of this assignment is to enable students to gain the skills to create, configure, and perform basic management of virtual machines on the Azure platform.

## Assignment Steps:

1-  Create an Azure Account:
* If you don't already have an Azure account, create a free Azure trial account.
You can take advantage of student benefits.

2- Create a Resource Group:

group.
* Give the resource group a meaningful name (e.g.,
"StudentNameSurname_RG").
* Select the location of the resource group (e.g., "West Europe").

3- Create a Virtual Machine:

* Go to the "Virtual machines" service in the Azure portal and create
a new virtual machine.
